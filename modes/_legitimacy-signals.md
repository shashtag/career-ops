# Block G — jurisdictional legitimacy signals 6–15

Split out of `modes/oferta.md` (#3602). Signals 1–5 stay inline there because they
are evaluated on every posting. These ten are different in kind: most are gated on a
`templates/*.yml` jurisdiction table, and `jurisdiction-lookup.mjs` answers `none` for
them in most searches — so for the majority of evaluations they resolve to "say
nothing" without any of the prose below being needed.

**Read this file when — and only when — one of these is true:**

- `jurisdiction-lookup.mjs --mode oferta` returned `APPLIES` or `UNCERTAIN` for a table;
- the JD carries a marker for one of the table-free signals (7, 9, 13, 14), listed in
  the index in `modes/oferta.md` → Block G.

When you do read it, the rules below are **mandatory and unchanged**: the
authorization-vs-status line, the exceptions honesty, the never-assert rules and the
phrasing discipline all still bind. Nothing here was softened by being moved.

---

**Jurisdiction resolution for signals 6–15 — one command, not four table reads.** Every signal below that names a `templates/*.yml` jurisdiction table opens with the same deterministic step: derive the candidate's jurisdiction key from `config/profile.yml` → `location`, then find the rows keyed to it. That step is a key match, and `jurisdiction-lookup.mjs` performs it. Run it once, before working the signals:

```bash
node jurisdiction-lookup.mjs --mode oferta            # verdict per table
node jurisdiction-lookup.mjs --mode oferta --json     # the matching rows themselves
```

Its verdicts are binding, and reading a table it reported on is redundant:

- `none` — no row for this jurisdiction. That signal is not evaluated; say nothing. Do not open the table to check: "no row for this key" is a lookup, not a judgement.
- `APPLIES` — take the matching rows from `--json` and apply the signal's own judgement to them. The tool never decides whether a signal fires.
- `UNCERTAIN`, or exit 2 — the jurisdiction could not be resolved at all, or not to the depth that table keys on (a `US-IL` row against a candidate whose profile names no state). Read the named table yourself, exactly as before. A quiet "nothing applies" is the one failure this tool must never produce, so it says so instead.

This replaces the read-the-table / derive-the-key mechanics inside each signal and nothing else. Every signal's own trigger conditions, the authorization-vs-status line, the exceptions honesty, the phrasing discipline and the never-assert rules stay exactly as written below, and stay mandatory.

**6. Employment Classification Risk** (from JD text; jurisdiction from `config/profile.yml` → `location.country`):

Every jurisdiction splits work into two buckets under different names: an "employment contract" carrying statutory protections and benefits, vs. a "service/labour/consulting contract" that doesn't — even when the day-to-day work looks identical from the outside. Candidates routinely can't tell which one a JD is offering until tax time or until a benefit they assumed they had turns out not to exist. Check the JD text against the jurisdiction-specific term list below (add a new row to extend to another country — this table is a data reference, not instruction logic, so extending it never requires touching the rule text):

| Jurisdiction | Contractor/services-status terms |
|---|---|
| Canada | "T4A", "independent contractor", "self-employed", "invoice for services" |
| US | "1099", "independent contractor", "W-2 not provided" |
| UK | "self-employed", "umbrella company", "outside IR35" / "inside IR35" |
| Other jurisdictions | "labour contract" vs "employment contract" phrasing, "service agreement", "consulting agreement" (e.g., 劳务合同 vs 劳动合同 in China) |

Plus a jurisdiction-agnostic structural check — **"contract position" alone is not enough to trigger this**, since plenty of legitimate fixed-term *employee* roles use that phrase. Only flag when the JD has explicit contractor-status wording (asks the candidate to "invoice," or to operate as a "consultant"/"freelancer," rather than being "hired"/"employed") **and** at least one corroborating omission (no benefits language, no vacation/PTO mention, no defined end date, no standard employment-standards phrasing, no mention of statutory deductions/withholding).

If this combination is present, append a short, non-alarmist note to the report (this is descriptive, never prescriptive — never tell the user to refuse a role):

> ⚠️ **Employment classification signal:** This posting uses language associated with contractor/services status rather than standard employee status — e.g. "{specific phrase found}". If eligibility for programs like CEC/PR depends on employee status, or if you want statutory benefits, deductions, and protections, confirm classification directly with the employer before accepting.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — it is orthogonal to ghost-job detection and is reported separately.

**7. AI-Buzzword vs. Infrastructure Mismatch** (from JD text, plus Block D research already gathered — no additional queries):

Some JDs describe the company the org *wants to become*, not the org as it is: heavy "AI enablement / digital transformation / process innovation" language sitting on top of infrastructure that is nowhere near ready for it. The candidate finds out only after burning a prescreen (or more) that the "AI" role is really digitization and backlog-cleanup work first, AI work maybe eventually. That can still be a fine role — but the candidate should know before applying, not after.

Check the JD for these three signal classes:

- **Buzzword density vs. role scope:** AI/transformation/innovation/enablement language is prominent, but the actual seniority, title, or listed responsibilities don't match ownership of transformation outcomes (e.g., a mid-level individual-contributor role expected to "drive AI transformation across the organization").
- **Team-size mismatch:** the JD mentions a small team (roughly 5 people or fewer) expected to own "transformation" outcomes for a large org — a common tell that the mandate outstrips the resourcing.
- **Industry base rate:** the company is in a traditional/legacy-heavy industry (manufacturing, aerospace/defense, industrial, heavy logistics) where basic digitization is often still incomplete — AI is being bolted onto a foundation that may not exist yet. This is a base rate, not a verdict: plenty of legacy-industry roles are genuine; it only counts as a signal in combination with the others.

**Only flag when 2+ of the three signal classes are present.** If flagged, append a short, non-alarmist note to the report (descriptive, never prescriptive — this can be exactly the kind of high-impact greenfield role some candidates want):

> ⚠️ **Buzzword/infrastructure mismatch signal:** This JD leans on AI/transformation language ("{specific phrases found}") while {signals observed: small team owning transformation outcomes / scope-seniority mismatch / legacy-heavy industry}. The day-to-day may be foundational digitization and backlog cleanup before any AI work. If you proceed, probe the actual state of their systems directly in interviews — e.g. "What are the top 3 most urgent things this role needs to fix right now?", "Which systems would I be working with, and how mature are they?" — rather than relying on the JD's framing.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — the posting can be entirely real and still oversell its AI maturity. It is orthogonal to ghost-job detection and is reported separately.

**8. Benefits/Employment Terminology Country Mismatch** (from JD text; cross-check stated location against jurisdiction-specific benefits/employment terms):

Some JDs are copy-pasted from a template built for a different country's postings, leaving behind benefits or employment-law terminology that belongs to the wrong jurisdiction — e.g. a Canada-located posting that lists "401(k)" or "W-2 employment," which are US-only terms. The posting can be entirely live and real and still describe the wrong country's benefits; this is a template-error detector, not a ghost-job signal. Check the JD's benefits/employment section against the jurisdiction-specific term list below (add a new row to extend to another country — this table is a data reference, not instruction logic, so extending it never requires touching the rule text):

| Jurisdiction | Strong markers (unconditional) | Corroborating-only markers |
|---|---|---|
| US only | "401(k)", "W-2 employment" | "PTO" — used in Canada and other jurisdictions too, so it never triggers this signal on its own; count it only when it appears alongside "401(k)" or "W-2 employment" in the same posting |
| Canada only | "RRSP", "T4" | "Employment Standards Act" spelled out — the bare acronym "ESA" is ambiguous (collides with other jurisdictions' usage) and must never be matched on its own |

Only flag when the JD's stated location is in jurisdiction A, but the benefits/employment section uses a strong marker exclusive to jurisdiction B, or a corroborating-only marker that co-occurs with a strong marker from jurisdiction B. A corroborating-only marker appearing by itself (e.g. "PTO" with no "401(k)"/"W-2," or a bare "ESA" with no expanded "Employment Standards Act") must never trigger this signal on its own. Generic terms ("health benefits," "retirement plan") should never trigger this on their own.

If this mismatch is present, append a short, non-alarmist note to the report:

> ⚠️ **Benefits terminology mismatch signal:** This posting is listed in {location}, but its benefits section uses {jurisdiction B}-specific terms ("{specific phrase found}"). This is often a copy-paste artifact from a template used for a different country's postings, and doesn't necessarily mean the posting is fake — but worth confirming with the employer/recruiter which country's employment terms actually apply before assuming the listed benefits package is accurate.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — it is orthogonal to ghost-job detection and is reported separately.

**9. Third-Party Platform Location Tag vs. Employer's Own Posting Mismatch** (conditional — only when both sources are available):

Possible causes include the job board auto-guessing or mis-scraping the location field, or a recruiter selecting the wrong region tag when cross-posting the same requisition to multiple markets. This can result in a candidate applying based on the platform-displayed location (thinking it's local), when the role is actually in a different country entirely — and not finding out until much later in the process.

This signal only triggers when **both** a third-party platform's displayed location (e.g. LinkedIn, Indeed) **and** the employer's own job page's stated location are available to compare, **and** both sources can be confirmed to refer to the same requisition/job ID (e.g. a matching req number or job ID visible on both sides) — not merely the same title or company, which can still represent two genuinely different requisitions. Evidence may come from what the user pasted/screenshotted, or — only when running the browser-backed `auto-pipeline` (not `openai-eval.mjs`, which passes JD text only into Block G and has no Playwright/browser access) — from `auto-pipeline`'s Playwright snapshot if it captures both. If only one source is available, or the two sources cannot be confirmed to share a requisition/job ID, skip this signal entirely.

When both are available, compare the two stated locations. Flag only if they name **different countries** — not just different cities within the same country, which is a much weaker/more ambiguous signal (e.g. genuine multi-office companies with several valid postings).

If triggered, append a short, non-alarmist note to the report:

> ⚠️ **Location tag mismatch signal:** This posting shows "{platform location}" on {platform name}, but the employer's own job page for the same posting states "{employer-page location}." Confirm the actual work location directly with the employer before assuming the platform-displayed location is accurate — this is sometimes a cross-posting/tagging error, not necessarily deceptive.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — it is orthogonal to ghost-job detection and is reported separately.

**Scope note:** This signal is prompt-instruction-only for now — the agent manually compares the two sources when both are present in what the user provided. It does not modify `check-liveness.mjs` or `liveness-core.mjs` to automatically fetch and compare both pages; that is out of scope for this pass and left as a future decision.

**10. Agency Licensing Check** (from JD text + `templates/agency-licensing.yml`; jurisdiction from `config/profile.yml` → `location` — same derivation as the employment-classification signal):

The first Block G signal keyed to **who posted** rather than what the posting says. Several jurisdictions require temporary help agencies and third-party recruiters to hold a licence to operate at all — and publish an official public registry where anyone can check an operator's status in one lookup. Unlicensed operators in a licensing jurisdiction are disproportionately the same ones running ghost postings, fee scams, and misclassification games, so telling the candidate that an authoritative one-click answer exists, and where, is high-value and zero-cost.

**Trigger — BOTH conditions required:**
1. The posting is **agency-mediated**: detected from the JD's own text (phrases like "our client", "on behalf of our client", a staffing/recruiting brand posting for an unnamed end employer — e.g. a fictional "Acme Staffing Group" advertising a role at an undisclosed manufacturer), or the user states in conversation that the role came through an agency or recruiter.
2. The candidate's jurisdiction has a row in `templates/agency-licensing.yml` — ask `node jurisdiction-lookup.mjs --table agency-licensing --json` rather than reading the table (the file is a data reference, not instruction logic: adding a jurisdiction row there never requires touching this rule text; every row carries the licensing scope, effective date, official registry URL, legal basis, transitional notes, sources, and an `as_of` verification date). **`none` → skip this signal silently** — absence of a row means "no verified regime data," not "no regime."

If both conditions hold, append a short, non-alarmist note to the report:

> ℹ️ **Agency licensing note:** [Render in {language.output}: state the regime facts from the table row and hand over the official registry link — e.g. for a fictional Acme Staffing Group posting evaluated by an Ontario candidate: "Ontario has required temporary help agencies and recruiters to hold a licence since 2024-07-01 (ESA 2000 + O. Reg. 99/23); the Ministry of Labour publishes a public status checker where you can look up any agency in one click: {registry.url}." Mention the client-side prohibition and penalties from the row as context for why licensed operators dominate the legitimate market. Note the transitional rule from the row (e.g. pre-deadline applicants may lawfully operate while their application pends), so the candidate reads the registry result correctly. Close with a note that this is information about the jurisdiction's licensing regime, not legal advice.]

**Tracker composition (suggestion only):** when this evaluation lands in the tracker with a `via={Agency}` field (#1596), suggest carrying the registry pointer into the tracker note — so the one-click check survives into the follow-up workflow. This mode **never writes the tracker itself**; tracker updates go through the normal TSV/`set-status.mjs` paths with the user in the loop.

**Hard rule (mandatory):** this signal **never asserts an agency is unlicensed** and **never fetches or scrapes the registry** — no WebFetch, no WebSearch, no Playwright against the registry URL; career-ops stays zero-fetch here by design. Transitional rules alone (operators with a pending pre-deadline application may lawfully operate) make "this agency is unlicensed" unknowable from outside the registry; only the official lookup, clicked by the candidate, answers it. State the regime facts and the pointer — never render this finding as an accusation that any specific agency is operating unlawfully.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — the posting can be entirely real and licensed; this is a jurisdiction-awareness pointer, reported separately.

**11. Immigration-Status Requirement Overreach** (from JD text; jurisdiction from `config/profile.yml` → `location` (country + city/province/state), same region-aware pattern as signal 6):

Some postings demand a specific immigration status — "US citizens only," "must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident," "must be permanently authorized to work" — that goes beyond what the candidate's own jurisdiction allows employers to require. Candidates who are fully authorized to work read these lines and self-select out. Check for it like this:

1. Ask `node jurisdiction-lookup.mjs --table immigration-status --json` for the rows keyed to the candidate's jurisdiction, rather than reading `templates/immigration-status-requirements.yml` in full. The table is a jurisdiction-keyed set of prohibited status-requirement patterns, each entry carrying a mandatory `lawful_screening_contrast`, `exceptions`, `legal_basis`, `enforcement_notes`, `sources`, and `as_of` date. It is a data reference, not instruction logic: extending it to another jurisdiction never requires touching this rule text, and every entry must carry a citable legal source, an `as_of` date, and a non-empty `lawful_screening_contrast` (see the contribution rule in the file header).
2. Verdict `none` → this signal is not evaluated; say nothing. Verdict `UNCERTAIN`, or exit 2 → read the table yourself and derive the key by hand (e.g. Ontario, Canada → `CA-ON`; anywhere in the United States → `US` for the federal row), exactly as before.
3. For each entry matching the candidate's jurisdiction, judge whether the JD text actually demands a specific immigration status per that entry's `prohibited_requirement_patterns` guidance. This is agent-judged, never naive keyword matching — presence-based only: the signal fires on status demands present in the posting text, never on the absence of anything.

**The authorization-vs-status line (mandatory — the entire signal hinges on it):** asking about *work authorization* is lawful; demanding a *particular immigration status* is the problem. Authorization and sponsorship screening questions — "Are you authorized to work in the United States?", "Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status?", "Are you legally authorized to work in Canada?" — are lawful screening per each entry's `lawful_screening_contrast` field and are NOT flagged by this signal, ever. If a candidate line could plausibly be read as either, read it as lawful authorization screening and do not flag. The one documented conversion to watch: a permanence qualifier ("authorized to work in Canada **permanently**") turns an authorization question into a status demand — that is the *Haseeb v. Imperial Oil* proxy pattern, and it fires.

**Exceptions honesty (mandatory):** every entry lists statutory situations where a status requirement is lawful (US: a citizenship requirement imposed by law, regulation, executive order, or government contract for the specific position, per 8 U.S.C. §1324b(a)(2)(C); Ontario: the three Code s.16 categories). When the posting names a plausible statutory hook — a government contract, a security-clearance requirement, an s.16 category — the output names the claimed hook instead of flagging cleanly (e.g. "this posting restricts eligibility to citizens and cites a federal contract requirement — such requirements are lawful when a government contract imposes them for the position; the contract itself is not verifiable from the JD"). For the US row, apply the export-control note: EAR/ITAR "US person" (15 CFR 772.1 / 22 CFR 120.15) matches §1324b(a)(3)'s protected-individual list — citizens AND green-card holders, refugees, asylees — so a posting citing ITAR/EAR as the reason for a *citizens-only* restriction is generally an employer over-reading of export-control rules, and the output should say so (as a fact about the regulations, not about the employer's intent).

**Phrasing discipline (mandatory):** state the verifiable fact about the posting text and the statute only — e.g. "this posting restricts eligibility to citizens; under 8 U.S.C. §1324b such restrictions are unlawful unless required by law, regulation, executive order, or government contract for this position." That is a fact about the statute and the posting text. Never assert that the employer is breaking the law or committing a violation: employer size, statutory hooks, and exemptions are not verifiable from the JD, so no such conclusion can be drawn from it.

If matched, append a short, warn-only note to the report:

> ⚠️ **Immigration-status requirement signal:** [Render in {language.output}: a factual statement that this posting contains "{the status demand, quoted from the JD}", a specific-immigration-status requirement; that under {jurisdiction_name}'s {legal_basis} such requirements are unlawful unless a listed exception applies (cite the entry's `legal_basis` and `exceptions` verbatim as data tokens, and the `enforcement_notes` where useful context); if the posting names a plausible statutory hook, name it here instead of flagging cleanly. Note that authorization/sponsorship questions are lawful screening and are not what this flag is about. Close with a note that this is informational only and not legal advice.]

**12. Jurisdiction-Prohibited Content** (from JD text; jurisdiction from `config/profile.yml` → `location` (country + city/province/state), same region-aware pattern as signal 6):

Some posting content is not just a yellow flag — it is content the candidate's own jurisdiction has explicitly prohibited employers from requiring or asking for (e.g. a "Canadian experience" requirement in Ontario postings, salary-history questions in California). Candidates either don't know their rights, or notice and have nowhere to record it. Check for it like this:

1. Ask `node jurisdiction-lookup.mjs --table prohibited-content --json` for the rows keyed to the candidate's jurisdiction, rather than reading `templates/jurisdiction-prohibited-content.yml` in full. The table is jurisdiction-keyed, each entry carrying legal basis, effective date, and sources. It is a data reference, not instruction logic: extending it to another jurisdiction never requires touching this rule text, and every entry must carry a citable legal source plus effective date (see the contribution rule in the file header).
2. Verdict `none` → this signal is not evaluated; say nothing. Verdict `UNCERTAIN`, or exit 2 → read the table yourself and derive the key by hand (e.g. Ontario, Canada → `CA-ON`; California, USA → `US-CA`), exactly as before.
3. For each entry matching the candidate's jurisdiction, judge whether the JD text actually contains the prohibited content per that entry's `matching` guidance. This is agent-judged, never naive keyword matching — e.g. "we will never ask for your salary history" in a fraud-warning footer must NOT fire, and a salary-*expectations* question is not a salary-*history* question.

**Phrasing discipline (mandatory):** state the verifiable fact about the posting text only — what the posting contains, what the jurisdiction's law prohibits, since when. Never assert that the employer is breaking the law or committing a violation: employer size, posting type, and statutory exemptions are not verifiable from the JD, so no such conclusion can be drawn from it.

If matched, append a short, warn-only note to the report:

> ⚠️ **Jurisdiction-prohibited content signal:** [Render in {language.output}: a factual statement that this posting contains "{the matched content, quoted from the JD}", which {jurisdiction_name}'s {legal_basis} has prohibited in {the scope stated by the entry, e.g. publicly advertised postings} since {effective date} — cite the entry's `legal_basis` and `effective` fields verbatim as data tokens. Describe the posting text only; draw no conclusion about the employer. Close with a note that this is informational only and not legal advice.]

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — it is orthogonal to ghost-job detection and is reported separately. It never blocks or discourages an application on its own; the candidate decides what to do with the information.

**13. Pay-Transparency Range-Width Check** (from JD text only — self-computed from the `advertised_comp` this mode already parses for Block B; no jurisdiction table, no external data file):

This signal is pure arithmetic on the posting's own stated numbers — no jurisdiction lookup, no legal threshold, no statute. It requires: the posting states a compensation range (both a bottom and a top bound); explicit, unambiguous, matching currency and period on the `advertised_comp` bounds (a bare `$` with no stated currency, or a range with no stated period, is ambiguous — do not guess); and both bounds normalized to the same period (e.g. monthly to annual) before subtracting. If either bound is missing, or currency/period is missing or ambiguous, skip this signal — never guess a currency or period. The two normalized bounds must also use the **same currency** and the normalized lower bound must be **strictly greater than zero (positive)** — if the bounds use mismatched currencies, or the normalized lower bound is zero or negative, skip this signal entirely; do not compute or flag it.

**"Unusually wide" heuristic (general, not jurisdiction-specific):** flag the range when its width (top minus bottom) exceeds **half of the range's own bottom bound** (i.e. `top - bottom > 0.5 × bottom`) — a fictional Acme Corp posting advertising "$60,000–$150,000/year" has a $90K width against a $30K half-of-bottom threshold, so it fires; "$90,000–$110,000/year" ($20K width against a $45K threshold) does not. This is a generic ratio heuristic the agent applies to any posting, in any jurisdiction — it is **not** a legal cap, and it does not imply any jurisdiction's disclosure law was consulted. State this plainly in the finding so it is never mistaken for a compliance check.

If the ratio fires, append a short, non-alarmist note to the report:

> ⚠️ **Pay-transparency range-width signal:** [Render in {language.output}: state the arithmetic fact only — e.g. "this advertised range is $90K wide on a $60K floor, more than half the floor" — then note that unusually wide ranges often mean the actual band for the level is undecided or the posting is templated/aggregated, and suggest asking the recruiter for the real band for this level. Make explicit that this is a general heuristic the agent applied to the posting's own numbers, not a jurisdiction-specific legal threshold. Close with a note that this is an observation about the posting, not legal advice.]

**Phrasing discipline (mandatory):** state only observable facts — the computed range width and the ratio that triggered the flag. Never render this finding as "the employer is breaking the law," an "illegal" posting, or a "violation," and never imply any jurisdiction's disclosure statute was checked — this signal has no legal basis and this mode never gives legal advice.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — it is orthogonal to ghost-job detection and is reported separately.

**14. Minimum-Wage Lawyer Question** (from `advertised_comp`; jurisdiction from the JD's stated location ONLY — NEVER from `config/profile.yml` → `location`, which describes the candidate, not the job; remote, relocation, and multi-location postings make that substitution wrong):

This system has no reliable way to keep a jurisdiction's statutory minimum wage current — general rates are CPI-indexed annually in many jurisdictions and move on legislated schedules this tool has no way to notice or verify. So this signal never asserts or compares against a minimum-wage figure of any kind. It does only the part that needs no legal table at all — converting the offer's own stated compensation into a comparable hourly rate — and routes the actual compliance question to a lawyer or an official source, using the same `[ask your lawyer]` pattern `modes/offer-prep.md` uses for jurisdiction-dependent questions.

**Comparable-amount gate (mandatory):** only convert when `advertised_comp` resolves to a **guaranteed, fixed cash amount**. Exclude: ranges (e.g. "$16-18/hour" has no single figure to convert), and any variable or non-cash component — bonuses, commissions, allowances, overtime pay, 13th-month/holiday pay, and benefits. If `advertised_comp` is `null`, a non-numeric phrase ("competitive"), a range, or otherwise not a guaranteed fixed cash figure, skip this signal — absence or non-fixed comp is the pay-transparency signal's territory, not this one's.

**Rate normalization:** when the fixed cash amount is already hourly, use it directly as the comparable figure. When it is annual or monthly, convert to hourly using the JD's own stated working hours whenever the JD gives one; only fall back to the conservative assumption of **2080 hours/year** (52 weeks × 40 hours; monthly × 12 first) when the JD is silent on hours, and **always disclose in the output which hours figure was used** (JD-stated or the 2080-hour fallback). If no usable hours figure or currency is available to complete the conversion, skip this signal rather than converting on an unreliable assumption.

**Jurisdiction resolution (mandatory):** resolve the posting's governing jurisdiction strictly from the JD's own stated work location — never from `config/profile.yml` → `location`. If the JD does not state a work location precisely enough to name a jurisdiction, skip this signal entirely: the lawyer question needs a named jurisdiction to be useful, and this system does not guess one.

**This fires whenever the gates above all pass.** It is a routing signal, not a red flag, and is never conditioned on whether the resulting figure looks high or low — this system does not compare it to anything, so it has no basis to judge. Append a short, neutral note to the report:

> **[ask your lawyer]** — [Render in {language.output}, filling in the computed hourly figure, the hours basis used for any conversion (JD-stated or the 2080-hour fallback), and the resolved jurisdiction name: "This offer works out to {X}/hour ({disclose the hours basis used}). Is that at or above the statutory minimum for my role in {jurisdiction_name}, and are any of the special rates (student, homeworker) relevant to me?"]

**Phrasing discipline (mandatory):** state only the arithmetic — the advertised figure, the hours basis used, and the resulting hourly rate. Never state, imply, or look up what the current statutory minimum wage is in any jurisdiction, and never claim the offer does or does not comply with it — this mode carries no jurisdiction table and gives no legal advice. Special/reduced rates (student, homeworker, etc.) are named only as a generic prompt for the lawyer to check; never assert that one applies or doesn't, since there is no table here to judge eligibility from.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — it is reported separately as its own finding, and (having nothing to compare the figure against) it is never a legitimacy corroborator either.

**15. AI-Screening Disclosure** (from JD text + `templates/jurisdiction-ai-screening-disclosure.yml`; jurisdiction from `config/profile.yml` → `location` — same derivation as the agency-licensing and immigration-status-requirement signals; jurisdiction-compliance-lens umbrella #2026, member #2892):

Several jurisdictions now require employers to disclose when they use AI or automated tools in hiring — a bias-audited AEDT for an NYC-resident candidate (NYC Local Law 144), AI video-interview analysis in Illinois (820 ILCS 42), or a high-risk recruitment AI system anywhere in the EU once the AI Act's high-risk obligations take effect (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 — see the table's `EU` row for the current effective date and its provisional-vs-final status; do not hardcode a date here, read it from the table so a future re-verification only touches the data file). This signal checks the posting text for two independent things and reports them side by side — it never conflates "posting is silent" with "employer is non-compliant," because some of these laws attach to a step (e.g. right before the video interview) that a job ad would never mention either way.

**(a) Presence check — disclosure language in the posting (agent-judged, presence-based, fires standalone):** scan the JD text for explicit AI/automated-screening disclosure — mentions that the process uses an AI-powered assessment, automated screening, algorithmic candidate evaluation, or a named AEDT/AI-interview vendor (each jurisdiction row's `disclosure_language_examples` gives illustrative patterns — agent-judged matching, never naive keyword regex). When present, this is purely informational: note that the posting discloses AI use, and if the candidate's jurisdiction has a matching table row, name which law that disclosure aligns with. Never framed as a problem — a compliant posting produces no warning.

**(b) Absence check — jurisdiction requires disclosure, posting says nothing (corroborating-only per the umbrella's evidence-strength rule — never fires standalone):** ask `node jurisdiction-lookup.mjs --table ai-screening-disclosure --json` for the rows keyed to the candidate's jurisdiction — `none` means this check is not evaluated, `UNCERTAIN` or exit 2 means derive the key by hand from `config/profile.yml` → `location` the same way the agency-licensing and immigration-status-requirement signals do (e.g. "Illinois, USA" → `US-IL`; anywhere in an EU member state → `EU`). **NYC is a stricter case, not a generic state match:** a row like `US-NY-NYC` may carry BOTH a `job_location_condition` and a `candidate_residency_condition` when a single law splits its obligations that way (Local Law 144 does — the bias-audit duty keys off where the job is based, the candidate-notice duty keys off where the candidate lives). This signal only ever has the candidate's own `config/profile.yml` location, never the job's, so it can only evaluate the `candidate_residency_condition` half, and only when that condition is satisfiable from what the profile actually says. A generic "New York, USA" or "New York State" location string is NOT sufficient — it does not distinguish an NYC resident (Manhattan/Brooklyn/Queens/The Bronx/Staten Island) from someone in Buffalo or Albany. Require an explicit NYC/borough-level string (e.g. "New York, NY", "Brooklyn, NY") before evaluating that row; a state-level-only location is silently not evaluated for it, same as having no row at all — never guess. No table row for the candidate's jurisdiction, or a row whose condition the profile's location string cannot satisfy → this signal is not evaluated for (b); say nothing. When a row (or the specific condition it evaluates) applies AND its `effective` date is on or before the posting's own date (or today's date, if the posting has no clear date) AND the JD shows no disclosure language at all from check (a), surface a corroborating-only note — never on its own as proof of anything, always paired with the honest caveat that some of these obligations (e.g. Illinois' pre-interview consent) attach to a later step this system cannot see.

**Phrasing discipline (mandatory, same discipline as every other umbrella member):** state the verifiable fact and the posting's own silence — NEVER assert the employer is breaking the law, skipped a required disclosure, or is non-compliant. A posting's silence is not evidence that disclosure never happens; it only means it isn't in the text this system can read.

If (a) fires, append a short, informational (never warning-style) note:

> ℹ️ **AI-screening disclosure note:** [Render in {language.output}: state that this posting discloses AI/automated-screening use — quote the specific phrase — and, if the candidate's jurisdiction has a matching table row, name the law it aligns with (e.g. "this posting states an AI-powered assessment is part of the process; New York City's Local Law 144 requires employers using an AEDT to have it bias-audited and post a public summary"). Frame this as informational, never as a compliance verdict — this system cannot verify whether the audit was actually performed or posted.]

If (b) fires (and only (b), i.e. no disclosure language present), append a short, non-alarmist note:

> ⚠️ **AI-screening disclosure note:** [Render in {language.output}: state the statutory fact and the posting's silence side by side — e.g. "this posting doesn't mention AI/automated screening; as of {effective date}, {jurisdiction_name} requires employers to disclose AI use in hiring under {law_name} — you may be entitled to ask directly." Include the honest caveat when relevant to the matched law (e.g. for Illinois: "this obligation attaches to the interview step itself, not the job ad, so the posting's silence here doesn't tell you whether disclosure happens before the interview"). Close with a note that this is informational only, not legal advice, and never assert the employer failed to disclose.]

**Hard rule (mandatory):** this signal never fetches or scrapes anything — no WebFetch, no WebSearch, no Playwright against `official_source.url`; career-ops stays zero-fetch here by design, same as the agency-licensing signal. It reads the JD text the mode already has and the candidate's own jurisdiction from `config/profile.yml`.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — it is orthogonal to ghost-job detection and reported separately. **Out of scope for this signal (deliberately deferred, #2892):** cross-referencing whether the candidate actually ended up on an AI-led interview via `invite-match.mjs`'s `isAIInterviewerPlatform` detection (#2676), and disclosure *capture* feeding the ATS-channel analytics layer (#1404/#1405) — both need their own design pass per the umbrella's own scoping note.

### Output format:

**Assessment:** One of three tiers:
- **High Confidence** -- Multiple signals suggest a real, active opening
- **Proceed with Caution** -- Mixed signals worth noting
- **Suspicious** -- Multiple ghost job indicators, investigate before investing time

**Signals table:** Each signal observed with its finding and weight (Positive / Neutral / Concerning).

**Context Notes:** Any caveats (niche role, government job, evergreen position, etc.) that explain potentially concerning signals.

### Prior-contact FYI (non-scoring)

Check the `responsiveness` axis of the `node company-history.mjs --company <company>` card, passing the company name as its own single, quoted argument — never splice it into a longer shell string, since company names can legitimately contain quotes, `$`, backticks, or `;`. Branch on `responsiveness.label` and append ONE informational line to the report. The `facts` array can hold several applications to the same company, so fill placeholders deterministically **per category**: for each placeholder use the most recent application matching THAT placeholder's own condition — fill a responded placeholder from the most recent responded fact, a silent placeholder from the most recent silent fact — rather than forcing one fact to serve both groups. When more than one application matches a category, append a separate count for that category (e.g. ", and {K} earlier applications with the same pattern") so no history is omitted or misrepresented:

- `silent-on-you` (fill from the most recent silent fact; if more than one silent application exists, append the count of the others):
> Note: you applied to {company} on {date}; no response in {N}d after {M} follow-ups. Not a legitimacy signal — factor into how much effort to invest.
- `mixed` (they answered at least one of your applications and went silent on another — a flat "no response" would be inaccurate). Fill the responded placeholders from the most recent **responded** fact and the silent placeholders from the most recent **silent** fact — two different applications — and give a separate count per category when more than one matches:
> Note: mixed history with {company} — they responded on #{responded_num} ({responded_date}) but went silent on #{silent_num} (applied {silent_date}, {N}d). Not a legitimacy signal — factor into how much effort to invest.

This is information about **your own history** with the company, not about this posting. It must NOT alter the 1-5 score and must NOT alter the Assessment tier above — those are driven exclusively by the `postingChurn` axis and the other Block G signals. If the label is `responded-before` or `no-history`, say nothing (silence is fine; no note needed).

### Edge case handling:
- **Government/academic postings:** Longer timelines are standard. Adjust thresholds (60-90 days is normal).
- **Evergreen/continuous hire postings:** If the JD explicitly says "ongoing" or "rolling," note it as context -- this is not a ghost job, it is a pipeline role.
- **Niche/executive roles:** Staff+, VP, Director, or highly specialized roles legitimately stay open for months. Adjust age thresholds accordingly.
- **Startup / pre-revenue:** Early-stage companies may have vague JDs because the role is genuinely undefined. Weight description vagueness less heavily.
- **No date available:** If posting age cannot be determined and no other signals are concerning, default to "Proceed with Caution" with a note that limited data was available. NEVER default to "Suspicious" without evidence.
- **Recruiter-sourced (no public posting):** Freshness signals unavailable. Note that active recruiter contact is itself a positive legitimacy signal.
